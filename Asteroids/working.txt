working:
- start menu art (animation)
- level selector art (animation)

issues:
- asteroidsis not roatating properly

ideas:
- save system (in the start menu you can sellect the save file)
- player buffs (after defeating a level, coin collecting + shop)

plan:
- oldschool asteroids
- asteroids coming at you in different patterns
- occasionally enemy spaceship appears
- 5 levels (tutorial, only rocks, first enemy, small strike force, boss encounter)
